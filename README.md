# KerasTris
A neural network plays a tic-tac-toe game implemented in C# and TensorFlow.NET

# Overview
KerasTris is a C# console application written to experiment with neural network models. It allows an human player to play tic-tac-toe against an AI driven opponent. The model of the neural network is prebuilt and pretrained. It was originated by an external application (not included in this project) written in Python with Keras libraries and it is loaded in the application at runtime. Also this project is a benchwork for experimenting with TensorFlow.NET and Keras.NET.
